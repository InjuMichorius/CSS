This project contains a food menu site using only HTML and CSS. It was created to experiment with pseudo selectors and unknown CSS properties. The assignment came from the HvA (Hogeschool van Amsterdam).

## Week 1
I decided to choose the __CSS-garden__ assignment, inspired by [CSS Zen Garden](http://www.csszengarden.com/). We need to choose at least 2 restrictions and 1 context. For the restrictions I chose __Apply SVG in shapes, masks and filters__ and __No squares, rectangles, circles and triangles__. For the context, I want to make use of the __print-stylesheet__. This way I can do whatever I want with the website without regarding printability (because the printed version will be more readable).

For this week I want to experiment with __shapes__ and __animation__. I chose the following poster and I want to make the sun rotate slowly. I also want the hangingman to fall down. Making shapes will be my biggest challenge, because I've never used this technique before.

## Week 2
This week I worked further on __shapes__ and __animation__. I decided I wanted to work on the __rotating sun__ first. I watched a [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiM4VhQsdZw&t=425s) on how to make a sun, and changed it to my own preferences. I then rotated the whole and ended up with my rotating sun. I also worked on the __hanging man__ animation, which was more challenging because I've never really worked with CSS animations before. I'm satisfied with the result, but might polish some things in the future.

I've also tried to recreate the __arch of text__. I used [this site](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/svg/curved-text-along-path/) to help me, but I haven't figured out why this doesn't work for me (yet). I think the solution is changing the __width__ and/or __font-size__.

I'm also starting to really get stuck on the restrictions. Next week I want to implement them.

## Week 3
I still haven't figured out the __Arch of text__, so I decided to let it be for what it was. I've changed the hangingman to a PNG, so you don't see the white background anynmore. I've tried a lot of different things for the __main__, but I still can't find anything fitting. 

I've decided what restrictions and context I want to use;
* Print-stylesheet
* Apply SVG in shapes, masks and context
* No circles, squares and triangles.

## Week 4
The endresult is a original, fun but not so accesable restaurant website. I'm most proud of my sun, because it really catches the eye. It was also a pretty easy task, but it costed a lot of time. Creating a main that fits well with the rest was one of the hardest things to do. I couldn't figure out what I wanted and in the end I got stuck, because I also needed to take the restrictions in account. I tried a lot of things on the main, whether I needed to use all recipes or just the categories and make the user choose.

I got a lot of new experiences out of this, which I will definatly use in the future. The "kickoff" was 100% a lifesaver, since it opens you up to new ideas on how to use CSS. It made me curious and excited to start. Animations is my favourite thing about CSS and I will explore this side more in the future.
